# AeroLoop
A waste management system to **salvage on-flight recyclables** on commercial flights, optimised for **minimal energy use, hardware cost and weight added** to aircraft, designed for the purpose of seperating International Catering Waste (ICW) from non-ICW, so that recyclables **do not have to be incinerated or landfilled**.
